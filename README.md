# 3d-graphics-painters-algo

### Description  
First time drawing a three dimensional object in using twgl (Tiny Web GL) to render the objects.  

I implemented color using Painter's Algorithm which sorts triangle color based on relative depth from the camera position.  

Project for a graphics class.
